  [Perfanalytics](https://perfanalytics.fr/) is an ongoing research project aiming at developing performance indicators using video analysis. The project is lead by the [French National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology (INRIA)](https://www.inria.fr/en)

  I worked on a variety of subjects, such as A.I. **Object Detection**, **3D projections** and **web interfaces**.

  It was an very enriching experience, during which I had the opportunity to work on a multiplicity of subjects, such as training of Deep Learning models, python Dashboards and 3D graphics.
