  The [Royal Game of Ur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Game_of_Ur) is one of the oldest board games still playable today. It was popular in ancient Mesopotamia around 2600 BC.

  I built an [online version](https://ur.thissma.fr/) of the game, supporting 3 game modes : 1v1, multiplayer online and against a bot.
